# anpe-mobile-app
React native app that keeps me informed of new post on a job offer website.

This is a project I'm working on for my brother's company in mali.
There is a national website here posting call for tenders. So this app is retrieving information
from the website and showing in the app. It will also have a push notifications to get the user notified anytime there 
is a new post on the website.
Since the website didn't provide any APIs, I had to build a web scrawler and develop APIs using nodeJs and Express.

Here is the repository for the backend: https://github.com/firsi/anpe-seachbot.git
